Click here for hosted page! [Birds of Aotearoa](https://leeja744.cspages.otago.ac.nz/assignment-1/)

The objective of this was to create a front-end for a web application that browsed the [NZBirds Dataset](https://www.birdsnz.org.nz/). 

This website is a single page application that is capable of dynamically searching, filtering and sorting through the birds.

As a bonus feature for this web application, the site is mobile friendly and there is a collapsible menu component.
