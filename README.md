# Birds of Aotearoa

Click here for hosted page!: [Birds of Aotearoa](https://leeja744.cspages.otago.ac.nz/assignment-1/)

The objective of this project was to create a front-end for a web application that browsed the [NZBirds Dataset](https://www.birdsnz.org.nz/). 

This website is a single page application that is capable of dynamically searching, filtering and sorting through the birds. 

As a bonus feature for this web application, the site is mobile friendly and there is a collapsible menu component.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
