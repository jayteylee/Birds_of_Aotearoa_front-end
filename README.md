This project was a completed as a part of the COSC203 (Web, Databases and Networks) paper at the University of Otago. 

The objective of this was to create a front-end for a web application that browsed the [NZBirds Dataset](https://www.birdsnz.org.nz/). 

This website is a single page application that is capable of dynamically searching, filtering and sorting through the birds. 

As a bonus feature for this web application, the site is mobile friendly and there is a collapsible menu component.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
